# RFID-Interfacing-with-PIC18F4550-Microcontroller
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) uses radio frequency to read information stored in a RFID card or tag. In this project we are going to Interface EM-18 RFID reader with 8051 microcontroller and display RFID card number on 16*2 LCD display. This wireless RF Identification is used in many systems like RFID Based Attendance System, security systems, voting machines etc. This project will also serve as proteus software simulation,  interfacing of 16*2 LCD with  PIC18F4550 microcontroller.
